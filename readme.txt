Plugin dependency management

== Description ==

This meta-plugin allows regular plugins to specify other plugins that they depend upon.

Example:

`
/*
Plugin Name: BuddyPress Debug
Depends: BuddyPress, Debug Bar
*/
`

What this does:

* Disables activation of *BuddyPress Debug* until both *BuddyPress* and *Debug Bar* are already activated.
* When either *BuddyPress* or *Debug Bar* are deactivated, *BuddyPress Debug* will also be deactivated.


> = Enriching dependency information =
> Unfortunately, very few plugins currently contain dependency information. If you'd like to enhance the information available to this plugin, you might want to install the [Known Plugin Dependencies](https://wordpress.org/plugins/known-plugin-dependencies/) plugin which acts as an add-on to this one.

**Development of this plugin is done [on GitHub](https://github.com/x-team/wp-plugin-dependencies). Pull requests welcome. Please see [issues](https://github.com/x-team/wp-plugin-dependencies/issues) reported there before going to the plugin forum.**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Error on activation: "Parse error: syntax error, unexpected..." =

Make sure your host is running PHP 5. The only foolproof way to do this is to add this line to wp-config.php (after the opening `<?php` tag):

`
var_dump(PHP_VERSION);
`

= What happens if a user doesn't have Plugin Dependencies installed? =

Nothing. The *Depends:* header will simply be ignored.

= Can I have grand-child plugins? =

Yes, the dependency chain can go as deep as you want.

= Defining virtual packages =

Say you have some useful functions that you would like to package up as a library plugin:

`
/*
Plugin Name: Facebook Lib
Provides: lib-facebook
*/
`

Now, dependant plugins can specify 'lib-facebook' as a dependency:

`
/*
Plugin Name: Cool Facebook Plugin
Depends: lib-facebook
*/
`

Besides being more robust, the *Provides:* header allows multiple plugins to implement the same set of functionality and be used interchangeably.
